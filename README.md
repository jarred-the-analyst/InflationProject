While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is commonly used to measure inflation, relying solely on it may not provide a comprehensive understanding of inflation. The CPI calculates price 
changes by considering a fixed basket of diverse goods and services, with each item assigned a weight based on its relative importance in average consumer spending. However, relying solely on the CPI can be 
misleading when examining specific categories of inflation. For instance, if we want to analyze the inflation effects on higher education, relying solely on the CPI would overlook the significant difference between 
the CPI and the college inflation rate. Additionally, the CPI attempts to adjust for changes in the quality of goods and services, but determining the appropriate quality adjustments can be challenging and subjective. 
Therefore, incorporating different types of measurements can offer better insights into inflation dynamics.
